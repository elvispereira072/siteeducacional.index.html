          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>Hello, my name is Elvis, and I'm a front-end developer and self-taught musician. I am committed to learning and contributing to a technology company, focusing on the development of user interfaces (UI).</p>

          <p>I am always seeking knowledge, exploring online resources and diving into tutorials.</p>

          <p>Despite the lack of financial resources to pay for college, I am often disappointed and discouraged with life, but I got up and went to study on my own, even so, this did not prevent me from acquiring skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with a focus on in front-end technologies. This determination reflects my passion for the path of programming.</p>

          <p>I have devoted all my efforts to improving my skills, constantly seeking to stay updated with best practices and the latest market trends.</p>

          <p>My goal is to continuously evolve as a developer, both in web and mobile application development. I am committed to taking on new challenges and commitments, learning new technologies that will propel us towards a better future. I firmly believe that my commitment, dedication and passion for development make me a good candidate, even though I am self-taught..</p>

          <p>I'm excited for the opportunity to contribute to the development team. I am completely confident that, with the right guidance and the opportunity to work on challenging projects, I can achieve exceptional results.</p>

          <p>In addition to programming studies, I am also passionate about music. I am a multi-instrumentalist, with the ability to play the guitar, drums, and percussion.</p>

          <p>I appreciate the opportunity and I am available for further clarification.</p>
