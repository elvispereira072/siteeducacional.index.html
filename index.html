           <h2>About me</h2>

           <p>Hello, my name is Ednir Elvis Pereira, and I am a front-end developer looking for an opportunity in the field. I am committed to learning and contributing to a technology company.

           <p>As a tireless self-learner, I am always seeking knowledge, exploring online resources, and immersing myself in tutorials available on renowned platforms such as YouTube. Despite the lack of financial resources for college, it has not stopped me from acquiring solid and proven skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a particular focus on front-end technologies. This determination reflects my unwavering passion for the field of programming.</p>

           <p>I have devoted all my efforts to improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, constantly seeking to stay updated with best practices and the latest market trends.</p>

           <p>My goal is to continuously evolve as a developer, both in web and mobile application development. I am committed to taking on new challenges and learning new technologies that will propel my career. I firmly believe that my commitment, dedication, and genuine passion for software development make me a unique candidate.</p>
            
           <p>I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the development team and create impactful solutions. I am a flexible professional with effective communication skills and a collaborative spirit. I am fully confident that with the right guidance and the opportunity to work on challenging projects, I can achieve exceptional results.</p>

           <p>In addition to programming studies, I am also passionate about music. I am a multi-instrumentalist with the ability to play the guitar, drums, and other instruments.

           <p>I am aware of the importance of other technologies such as JavaScript and frameworks like React, and I am willing to learn and improve with the support of a team.</p>

           <p>I appreciate the opportunity and I am available for further clarification. I am ready to contribute with my foundational knowledge and evolve alongside the team.</p>

             <h3>My Second Portfolio</h3>

            <p>I developed this site as my second portfolio, demonstrating my skills as a front-end developer. I used HTML and CSS to create the structure and style of the site, focusing on the user experience and presentation of my previous projects.</p>
            
            <p>In this project, I applied the knowledge I acquired through self-study using online resources. I used CSS techniques such as flexbox and media queries to ensure the responsiveness of the website on different devices and screen sizes. Additionally, I implemented subtle animations and smooth transitions to enhance interactivity and improve the user experience.</p>
